# Concrete-Compressive-Strength
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. Analysis of strength of concrete using design of experiments and machine learning algorithms.
